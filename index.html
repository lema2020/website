		<div>Swimming: mainly cliffs in Nervi, but you can go to Bagni Medusa (food is good here, too) or Bagni Scogliera (both sunchairs), or the public beach: Spiaggia di Caprafico (for free)

Sporty acivities: canoeing starting at Particiolo di Nervi, tracking, running, walking in Parchi di Nervi - day trip to one of the Cinque Terre (easily reachable from the train station of Nervi), going by ferry from Porticiolo di Nervi to San Fruttuoso di Camogli (veeeery nice beach) and back, going by train to Camoglie (there are also ferries from there to Portofino and San Fruttuoso), day trip from by train from Nervi to Sestri Levante which has a very nice beach

City trip to Genova (ok, this would deserve an own website, there are tourist guides only for the city of Genova so we will mainly focus on Nervi) but there are million of things to do and a wealth of history, Emas Recommandation: Palazzo Rosso (which has a roof top where you have a perfect overview of the city).

Bus number 17 takes you directly from Nervi to the centre. Alternatively, bus 15 is also a good choice and goes along the cost. Bus tickets are available at Tabaccherias (you can also ask us for tickets) </div>
		<div>Well, obviously walk the Passeggiata Anita Garibaldi (about 2 km long), start at Porticciolo di Nervi</div>

		<div>We have a special deal with Villa Bonera 77€ per night for a double room with bathroom including breakfast, 70€ for every additional night

For an even cheaper option there is also the possibility to have a double room without bathroom but including breakfast (so the bathroom and shower would be in the hallway) for 67€ per night (60€ for every additional night). 

The villa is quite small, so better be quick if you decide to stay here. Please e-mail us if you want to stay in Villa Bonera so we can reserve a room for you
